This method is commonly used against organizations that have a large number of users, leveraging weak or reused passwords. Mitigation includes enforcing strong password policies, implementing account lockout mechanisms, and monitoring failed login attempts.",
      "generated": "T1110 is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. T1110.003 specifically refers to \"DLL Search Order Modification.\"\n\nThis tactic involves modifying the search order of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) in the Windows operating system. By doing this, an attacker can force their malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the legitimate one, thereby executing their code.\n\nThe search order is determined by the system's PATH environment variable, system32 directory, and the current directory. By adding a malicious DLL to the PATH, an attacker can ensure their DLL is loaded instead of the legitimate one. This can lead to code injection and execution of malware.\n\nThis tactic is often used in combination with other techniques, such as spear-phishing, to deliver the malicious DLL to the target system. Once the DLL is executed, the attacker can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious activities.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it's important to keep all systems updated, use security software, limit user privileges, and be cautious about opening attachments or clicking links in unsolicited emails. Regularly scanning for signs of unauthorized changes to the PATH environment variable can also help detect potential threats."

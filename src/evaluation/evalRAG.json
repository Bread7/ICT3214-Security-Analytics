In both cases, the emails are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry, and adversaries usually rely upon User Execution to gain access to victim systems. T1566.001 employs the use of malware attached to an email, while T1566.002 employs the use of links to download malware contained in the email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments."

    "reference": "CVE-2020-0601, also known as the CurveBall vulnerability, affects the Windows CryptoAPI. It allows attackers to spoof certificates by exploiting improper validation of ECC certificates. This can result in man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and impersonation of legitimate websites.",
    "generated": "The CVE-2020-0601 Windows CryptoAPI is a vulnerability identified in the Windows CryptoAPI component, affecting cryptographic validation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign a digital certificate with a weak key, potentially allowing forged digital signatures. This could lead to various attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and code signing frauds.\n\nMore specifically, the vulnerability exists because of the way CryptoAPI handles certain cryptographic operations. It allows an attacker to generate a weak key, use it to sign a digital certificate, and the system would still accept it as a valid certificate. This bypasses the intended purpose of digital certificates as a means to authenticate the identity and integrity of code or communication, making it easy for attackers to execute malicious code, intercept sensitive information, or impersonate trusted parties."

This technique does not involve the setuid or setgid bits, as the setuid and setgid bits only allow applications to run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.\n\nT1548.001 (Setuid and Setgid), on the other hand, is a technique related to the configuration of applications on Linux or macOS, where the setuid or setgid bits are set, enabling these applications to run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. This allows the application to perform tasks that would normally require higher privileges, but without providing the user running the application the same elevated privileges."

It was part of the EternalBlue payload within the Shadow Brokers' leak of NSA exploits, and was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017.\n\nThe exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on a targeted system. This was especially problematic because many systems still had SMBv1 enabled, despite Microsoft recommending its disabling due to security risks.\n\nReference(s): http://egavilanmedia.com, https://github.com/hemantsolo/CVE-Reference/blob/main/CVE-2017-0144.md, https://vuldb.com/?id.86563, https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.86563, https://github.com/Pe4cefulSnow/CVE-Advisory/blob/main/README.md, https://github.com/grymer/CVE, https://github.com/rosembergpro/CVE-2017-0144, https://github.com/soursec/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2017-0144, https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre/tree/main/CVE-2017-0144, https://github.com/TEAM-C4B/CVE-LIST/tree/master/CVE-2017-0144\""

This method is commonly used against organizations that have a large number of users, leveraging weak or reused passwords. Mitigation includes enforcing strong password policies, implementing account lockout mechanisms, and monitoring failed login attempts.",
    "generated": "T1110.003 (Brute Force: Password Spraying) is a technique in which adversaries attempt to acquire valid account credentials by using a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts on a network. This method helps adversaries avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. The passwords used in password spraying often adhere to the password policy of the domain, making them more likely to be valid.\n\nIn the provided context, no specific examples of password spraying exploitation are mentioned, but it's common for this technique to be employed during a breach to access Valid Accounts (T1078) within a victim environment. This can be done by leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as OS Credential Dumping (T1003), Account Discovery (T1087), or Password Policy Discovery (T1201)."

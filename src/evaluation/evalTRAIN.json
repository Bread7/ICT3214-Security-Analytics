    "generated": "Answer: T1564.010\n\nDescription: An attacker may use a legitimate service to conduct spearphishing. This technique is often used to bypass security controls that are present on email services. For example, an attacker may use a legitimate mailing service to send spearphishing emails to victims. By using a legitimate service, the email may appear to be legitimate and may evade spam or malware filters, potentially allowing it to reach the victim's inbox.\n\nIn this technique, the attacker typically uses a legitimate service to send spearphishing emails. For example, an attacker may use a legitimate mailing service to send spearphishing emails. By using a legitimate service, the email may appear to be legitimate and may evade spam or malware filters, potentially allowing it to reach the victim's inbox.\n\nThe attacker may use the legitimate service to send spearphishing emails as part of an ongoing campaign. For example, an attacker may send spearphishing emails to victims, then wait for a victim to respond. The attacker may then use the information in the response to further the attack.\n\nTargets: Email services that are used by a large number of organizations, such as Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, and Outlook.\n\nDetections: Email services that block malicious content may block spearphishing emails. Email services may also have spam filters that can detect and block spearphishing emails.\n\nMitigations: Email services may have policies that can prevent spearphishing emails from reaching the inbox, such as filtering based on the domain of the email or the reputation of the sender. Organizations may also use security solutions such as email threat defense platforms to block spearphishing emails."

    "generated": "Answer: T1548.002 is a sub-technique of the technique Deployment Packages from Application Store/Gallery. This technique involves downloading and running an application from an official app store or gallery. An attacker can create an application that looks legitimate and hosts malware, and distribute it through the app store or gallery. This technique is similar to T1548.001, in that it involves using official distribution channels to distribute malware. However, T1548.002 is specifically focused on using application stores or galleries for the distribution of malware.\n\nDetails:\n\nAdversaries may create or repackage legitimate applications to include malicious code. The applications can be distributed through official application stores or galleries, such as Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Microsoft Store. These application stores can be used to distribute malware in a legitimate and trusted manner.\n\nOnce malicious code has been included in an application, the code can be executed on a system when the application is launched. The code can be designed to persist, allowing the malware to remain on the system even after the application has been uninstalled or removed.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe use of official application stores or galleries for the distribution of malware is a common tactic that can lead to the compromise of systems. While application stores and galleries are designed to provide users with trusted applications for download and installation, the inclusion of malicious code by attackers can bypass these security controls.\n\nTo mitigate this tactic, organizations may implement security controls to prevent the execution of malicious code, such as code signing, sandboxing, and URL filtering. Additionally, organizations may block the execution of suspicious applications by using whitelisting, file type filtering, and other controls.\n\nDetections:\n\n* Applications that appear to be legitimate, but are found to contain malicious code, can be flagged for further review or automatically blocked.\n* Application stores and galleries can be monitored for suspicious or malicious applications, and blocked from distribution.\n* User-defined rules can be used to block the execution of suspicious applications, based on their file type or other characteristics.\n* Applications that are not signed or have untrusted certificates can be blocked from execution or blocked from launching.\n* Security controls, such as file type filtering and sandboxing, can be used to prevent the execution of malicious code.\n\nMitigations:\n\n* Use code signing to verify the authenticity of applications and prevent malicious code from being executed.\n* Implement sandboxing to isolate applications from the underlying system and prevent malicious code from accessing system components.\n* Use URL filtering to block the execution of potentially malicious code from being loaded into memory.\n* Implement whitelisting and file type filtering to prevent the execution of suspicious applications or files.\n* Regularly review and monitor application stores and galleries for suspicious or malicious applications, and block them from distribution."

This method is commonly used against organizations that have a large number of users, leveraging weak or reused passwords. Mitigation includes enforcing strong password policies, implementing account lockout mechanisms, and monitoring failed login attempts.",
    "generated": "Answer: T1110.003 is a technique that involves attempting to guess user credentials through a brute force attack. The adversary may use a list of valid or commonly used usernames and passwords to repeatedly attempt to log in to a system. Password spraying is a variation of this technique that involves using a large set of credentials that may or may not be valid to attempt to log in to a system. Password spraying can be used by adversaries to gain initial access to a system without having to first gain knowledge of valid user credentials. Password spraying can also be used to gain access to systems that do not require authentication, such as web applications.\n\nAdversaries may use password spraying to attempt to guess user credentials in situations where they may not have access to user credentials. For example, adversaries may use password spraying to attempt to gain access to web applications that do not require authentication or that do not require authentication with a specific user account or domain. Adversaries may also use password spraying to attempt to guess user credentials for systems that have been compromised by other means and have not been reconfigured with strong authentication.\n\nTo perform password spraying, adversaries may use a list of valid or commonly used usernames and passwords to repeatedly attempt to log in to a system. Password spraying can be automated through scripts or tools that automatically cycle through a large set of credentials. Adversaries may also use password recovery tools to attempt to recover passwords for accounts that have been compromised or for accounts that have been locked out due to multiple failed login attempts.\n\nPassword spraying is typically detected and blocked by intrusion prevention systems. To defend against password spraying, organizations can configure their intrusion prevention systems to block or restrict the number of failed login attempts before locking out an account. Organizations can also enforce strong authentication requirements for access to systems and web applications. Strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, can make password spraying more difficult or impossible to perform."
